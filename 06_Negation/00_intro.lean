Up until now, we've said that if we can
construct a proof of a proposition, then
we can judge it to be true. We haven't 
considered false as a possible judgment.
Instead we will provide a way to judge
the proposition, ¬ P, pronounced as not
P, to be true.

¬ P is the proposition that there can 
be no proof of P, and the way that this
is expressed is with the proposition 
that if there were such a proof, it 
would lead to a contradiction, which 
is to say an inconsistency, which is 
to say, a proof of false. ¬ P is thus 
a shorthand for P → false.  If ¬ P is
true, and as there is no proof of 
false, it must be there there is no
proof of P. 

This leads us to propositions built
using the ¬ connective. Take ¬ P as an
example. What this means in Lean is
simply that P → false.

You've got nothing in the context from which to construct a proof of P. Proof by 
contradiction is not constructive and so can't be done in plain Lean, Coq, etc.

Note that in order to use proof by contradiction we have to abandon purely
constructive logic and employ classical logic.
